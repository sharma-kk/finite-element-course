abstract = {The finite element discretisation technique is used to effect a solution of the Navier- Stokes equations. Two methods of formulation are presented, and a comparison of the effeciency of the methods, associated with the solution of particular problems, is made. The first uses velocity and pressure as field variables and the second stream function and vorticity. It appears that, for contained flow problems the first formulation has some advantages over previous approaches using the finite elemental method[1,2].}
